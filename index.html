    	<h2>About Me</h2>

    		<img src="phillies.jpg">

    		<p>An innovative People Systems and Analytics Manager with the ability to create and implement strategies that support business and financial objects. In my current role, I redesigned our Human Resources Scorecard to be intuitive and easier to read. As part of the Hollywood Casino Columbus opening team – I created the process to ensure 1,100 of our employees were licensed by the Ohio Casino Control Commission in a smooth orderly fashion over an eight week period. The process at Hollywood Casino Columbus received praise from the Ohio Casino Control Commission and our process was adopted by the other casinos in Ohio at the request of the Commission.</p>


			<p>Currently, I am a student at We Can Code IT, a software development boot camp focused on full-stack development.  We are learning Java, HTML, and CSS.  In addition, I am computer savvy in numerous software applications including the Microsoft Office Suite, UltiPro HRIS, ADP Vantage, ACSC, Kronos, and Cognos 10. Enthusiastic about learning and using new technologies and enhancing current technical expertise.</p>

			<p>When I am not working, you can find me knitting, spending time with my family, or training for my next race with my Italian Greyhound, Frankie.</p>
